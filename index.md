Hey, Im Vojtech and I am going to be talking about my bachelor thesis.

At the beginning I wasn’t really sure what my topic is going to be and I was kind of lost.

But after a lot of thinking and a lot of not great ideas I decided to create my own fashion film.

Which was a risky decision because my experience in videography field is not very extensive. But I decided that this is the right way so I had to make it work.

The goal was to create approximately 3 minutes long movie that is showing a fashion product in a creative way.

After I managed to find a fashion designer that was willing to borrow me one of his pieces I got to work.

I wanted the video to match the clothing’s energy and atmosphere and because the product was a black leather set of jacket and pants the video ended up being quite dark itself.

Main element that I used for the film was contrast. I used contrast between black and white, between details shots and bigger scenes and between quick cuts and slower pace.

Lot of the inspiration came from the theoretical part of my thesis where I analyzed history of fashion photography, fashion film and artists like Nick Knight and SHOWstudio which gave me a better picture of how I want my film to look.

The filming itself was difficult for me which is the reason why I used a lot of street shots that doesn’t include the product. Because I often wonder around with my analog camera and look at world through its lens. So here I did that with a video camera which helped me to work with video media in a way that is more familiar to me.

In the end I created a fashion film that I am proud of and definitely don’t regret my decision to choose this topic. However I see a lot of things that I would like to do differently and better. I learned a lot of things on the way and I am ready to continue creating which Im grateful for.

Thank you
